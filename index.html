I moved my blog from [naiborhujosua.medium](https://naiborhujosua.medium.com/) to Fastpages blog. This page catalogs my writings on a variety of topics related to my journey as a [self-taught Machine learning Engineer](https://course.fast.ai/), [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/naiborhujosua), [papers](https://arxiv.org/), books I am currently reading,  and related interests. 
Primary topics include Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, and Deep Learning.
