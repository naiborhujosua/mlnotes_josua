Josua is a business development analyst who turns into a self-taught Machine Learning Engineer. His interests include statistical learning, predictive modeling, and causal inference.
He loves running and it teaches him against giving up doing anything, even when implementing the Machine Learning Lifecycle(MLOps).

Apart from pursuing his passion for Machine Learning, he is keen on investing in the Indonesian Stock Exchange and Cryptocurrency.

His next dreams are to run a marathon in Boston Marathon, TCS New York City Marathon and Virgin Money London Marathon.
